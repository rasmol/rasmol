[02/03/94]	RS	pixutils.c
		Improved the efficiency of the RasMol polygon rendering.

[02/03/94]	RS	command.c tokens.h
		Added the "colour trace" command (and the "trace" command)
		to make "trace" synonymous with the "backbone" command.

[01/03/94]	RS	abstree.c abstree.h command.c tokens.h
		Added the rasmol "define" command to allow sets to be
		defined by the user.

[01/03/94]	RS	command.c tokens.h
		Added the RasMol "echo" command.

[28/02/94]	RS	outfile.c
		Improved the implementation of "write vectps" to correctly
		handle wireframe intersections with spheres and to draw
		cylinder bonds to produce effective ball & stick pictures.

[22/02/94]	RS	command.c render.c transfor.c
		Added nucleic acid ribbon representations. By default, a
		nucleic acid ribbon is 720 RasMol units wide. The O5* atom
		defines the RNA ribbon plane, and the midpoint between O5*
		and O2P defines the DNA ribbon plane.

[21/02/94]	RS	command.c tokens.h render.h
		Added RasMol commands "set axes", "set boundbox" and "set
		unitcell" to display additional objects.

[17/02/94]	RS	transfor.c transfor.h
		Added the RasMol command "colour structure" to colour proteins
		by secondary structure type. Removed the "user" colour option
		from the UNIX menu system and replaced with "structure".

[16/02/94]	RS	command.c transfor.c
		Changed the semantics of "ribbons 0" and the RasMol "ribbons"
		menu option to display ribbons whose width varies by secondary
		structure type.

[15/02/94]	RS	rasmol.c raswin.rc
		Changed the menu item "Save" to "Export" which makes more 
		sense for generating image files.

[14/02/94]	RS	raswin.c x11win.c graphics.h command.c tokens.h
		Added the "set mouse" command to RasMol to allow the RasMol
		mouse bindings to emulate other packages. RasMol currently
		supports "set mouse insight" and "set mouse quanta".

[13/02/94]	RS	rasmol.1 rasmol.hlp rasmol.html raswin.hlp
		Completed work on the RasMol "on-line" help preparation
		system. Now the UNIX man pages, Microsoft Windows help,
		Mosaic HTML and RasMol/RasWin online help is prepared from
		the same source. All these files are now up to date.

[10/02/94]	RS	command.c tokens.h molecule.c molecule.h
		Added the rasmol "show symmetry" command.

[27/01/94]	RS	rasmol.c
		Improved command line editting under VAX VMS. Fixed VMS bug
		that caused the process to "crash" after RasMolExit().

[26/01/94]	RS	rasmol.c
		Extended VAX VMS port of RasMol using ASTs to allow the
		asynchronous receipt of characters from SYS$INPUT:

[26/01/94]	RS	graphics.h command.c
		Allow the command line state (prompt) to enable/disable
		the menu buttons, this solves a GUI style flaw/bug.

[07/01/94]	RS	molecule.c transfor.c
		Corrected potential bugs when detailing with upper and lower
		bounds on Main and Heta residue numbers and temperatures.

[07/01/94]	RS	x11win.c
		Made the second and third mouse buttons synonymous.

[07/01/94]	RS	molecule.c molecule.h command.c tokens.h
		Added the RasMol "renumber" command to ensure sequential
		residue numbering alongs macromolecular chains.

[07/01/94]	RS	transfor.c transfor.h command.c tokens.h
		Added the RasMol "centre" command to allow rotation of a
		molecule about the centre of gravity of a given set of atoms.

[06/01/94]	RS	x11win.c
		Solved colourmap problem on Silicon Graphics machines that
		caused some colours to be displayed incorrectly!

[06/01/94]	RS	abstree.c
		Corrected bug in ParsePrimitiveExpression that caused general
		wildcards (i.e. "*" and "*.*") to be treated incorrectly.

[05/01/94]	RS	x11win.c
		Renamed the variable "shminfo" to avoid a name clash when
		compiling on the DEC Alpha using OSF/1 and Ultrix. Thanks
		to Dan Jacobson.

[04/01/94]	RS	!Started visiting research post with the 
		Protein Biochemistry group at Glaxo Group Research, 
		Greenford, Middlesex.
