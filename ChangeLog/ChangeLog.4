[06/06/94]	RS	raswin.c rasmol.h molecule.c render.c
		Completed port of RasMol v2.4 to Windows NT. Thanks to
		David Stranz and David Digby.

[05/06/94]	RS	outfile.c
		Corrected bug in generating Vector Postscript in RasWin,
		resulting in the image appearing inverted on the page.
		Thanks to Tomasz Heyduk.

[01/06/94]	RS	raswin.c raswin.rc raswin.idm
		Added CHARMm format files to the RasWin file open dialog box
		and added the "Strands" menu item to the "Display" menu.

[01/06/94]	RS	outfile.c transfor.c transfor.h
		Optimised representation of molecule in generated RasMol
		script files by detecting "cpk" colours and VdW radius.

[31/05/94]	RS	outfile.c
		Added complete support for writing out the current molecule
		representation in a RasMol script file using "write script".

[31/05/94]	RS	molecule.c transfor.c
		Improved lazy calculation of hydrogen bonding and disulphide
		bridges, hence "hbonds off" and "colour hbonds none" no longer
		force evaluation.

[27/05/94]	RS	command.c render.c transfor.c
		Modified the DisplayRibbon routine to allow the simultaneous
		display of strands and ribbons. Removed the "set ribbons"
		command and replaced it with "ribbons" and "strands".

[26/05/94]	RS	transfor.c render.c
		Changed the way that ribbons are selected and rendered in
		different colours. This brings the ribbon rendering in line
		with alpha carbon position and colouring.

[23/05/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Corrected bug in LoadAlchemyMolecule that resulted in molecules
		having the wrong chirality. Thanks to Mikhail Matrosovich.

[20/05/94]	RS	outfile.c
		Improved the Molscript script file interface. The RasMol
		"write molscript" command now stores the scaling, translation
		and slabbing (z-clipping) information. Thanks to Kevin Gardner.

[20/05/94]	RS	raswin.c
		Corrected bug that caused the DIB copied to the clipboard or
		DDE'ed to another application to have the wrong colour map.

[19/05/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Corrected bug in RasMol that caused it to report far too many
		ladders in DSSP. Changed references to "Ladders" to "Strands".

[19/05/94]	RS	molecule.c molecule.h command.c tokens.h
		Added support for CHARMm format co-ordinate files. Thanks to 
		Charles Brooks.

[18/05/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Removed interchain bonding. This makes loading a multi-chain
		protein faster and allows for RMS fitting with RasMol.

[18/05/94]	RS	command.c tokens.h transfor.c transfor.h render.c 
		pixutils.c
		Added a second colour to RasMol strands ribbons. Hence, the
		command "colour ribbons1 blue" and "colour ribbons2 red" 
		draws blue ribbons with the outmost stands in red.

[17/05/94]	RS	command.c render.c render.h
		Renamed the command "set dots" to "set radius" and added the
		command "set solvent" which controls the dot surface as 
		either VDW or solvent accessible. The radius controls either
		the VDW radius or the Solvent Probe Sphere radius.

[16/05/94]	RS	raswin.c
		Added scroll bar and terminal history to the RasMol command 
		line window. Improved scrolling in resized windows.

[12/05/94]	RS	raswin.c rasmol.c mswin31.c transfor.c
		Corrected bug in RasMol that resulted in the "specular",
		"specpower" and "ambient" parameters not being reset by a
		RasMol "zap" command and fixed initial RasWin CMap.

[12/05/94]	RS	command.c tokens.h abstree.c abstree.h
		Added the atom property "elemno" that uniquely identifies
		each atoms element type, hence "select elemno=26" identifies
		all sulphur atoms.

[12/05/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Added a test to check if the PDB x, y and z co-ordinates of
		an atom are 9999.000 indicating an XPLOR pseudo atom. Thanks
		to Chris Littler and Harren Jhoti.

[11/05/94]	RS	command.c render.c render.h
		Added the command "set dots <value>" to set the probe
		sphere radius for calculating the solvent accessible 
		surface of a protein.

[11/05/94]	RS	render.c
		Corrected bug when drawing thin cylinders since the change
		to DrawTwinLine for axes, bounding box and unit cell.

[10/05/94]	RS	raswin.c
		Corrected bug in the DDE formating of the picked atoms
		co-ordinates.

[10/05/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Fixed bug in RasMol that incorrectly determined the lowest
		residue number in PDB files that are unordered. Thanks to
		Ken Davis.

[09/05/94]	RS	molecule.c molecule.h command.c render.c tokens.h
		Fully implemented the RasMol commands "set unitcell" and
		"show symmetry", these now take the crystal symmetry 
		information from the CRYST1 record of a PDB file.

[03/05/94]	RS	render.c
		Corrected RasWin problem in DisplayRibbon caused by rounding
		when interpolating Z-coordinates with large ZOffset.

[03/05/94]	RS	transfor.c
		Corrected RasWin overflow bug in ScaleColourAttrib that 
		caused `hot' atoms to be displayed black instead of red.

[03/05/94]	RS	rasmol.doc
		Corrected several typographic mistakes and errors within
		the rasmol documentation. Thanks to Naoum Salame.

[29/04/94]	RS	raswin.c mswin31.c
		Managed to trace a RasWin colour map initialisation problem
		that occasionally caused RasWin to crash with a GDI error or
		start with wrong colour background. Thanks to Dave Digby.

[28/04/94]	RS	x11win.c
		Corrected buffer char types in x11win.c that were causing
		warnings on pedantic compilers. Thanks to Ethan Merritt.

[20/04/94]	RS	outfile.c
		Added support for vector PostScript output of dot surfaces.

[20/04/94]	RS	render.c render.h command.c transfor.c transfor.h 
		tokens.h
		Added a Van der Waals dot surface representation to RasMol.
		The command "dots <boolean>" enables and disables a dot
		surface of the currently selected atoms. "dots <value>" can
		control the dot density, "colour dots" colours the whole
		dot surface a given colour [the default is taken from atoms]

[20/04/94]	RS	rasmol.c
		Corrected bug with including <unistd.h> on Evans & Sutherland
		ESV workstations.

[19/04/94]	RS	render.c
		Solved a bug in IdentifyAtom that refused to identify picked
		non-connected atoms when bonds are being displayed.

[19/04/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Corrected bug in loading alchemy format files. Atom serial
		numbers were incorrect resulting in incorrect bonding. Thanks
		to Ben Gaskins.

[18/04/94]	RS	render.c render.h tokens.h command.c
		Added the commands "set axes" and "set boundingbox" to display
		the co-ordinate axes and molecule bounding box on screen.

[18/04/94]	RS	pixutils.c
		Corrected bug in routines `ClipLine' and `ClipVector' which
		caused lines that clipped the bottom of the screen to bend.

[18/04/94]	RS	raswin.c
		Corrected bug in the DDE transfer of CF_DIB objects for the
		DDE "Image" item. Thanks to Dave Digby and Ken Davis.

[15/04/94]	RS	rasmol.c raswin.c abstree.h transfor.c molecule.c 
		molecule.h
		Better support for the display of small molecules. Smaller
		bond cylinder radius for `sticks' images of molecules with
		less than 256 atoms, and use unadjusted Van der Waals radius 
		for molecules containing explicit hydrogen atoms.

[15/04/94]	RS	molecule.c
		RasMol now uses the connectivity specified in PDB CONECT
		records when displaying molecules with less than 256 atoms,
		i.e. small compounds. Thanks to Brian Dunford-Shore.

[14/04/94]	RS	rasmol.h raswin.c
		Extended the range of items exported by DDE to include the
		picked atom's co-ordinates and the image being drawn on
		the screen (transfered as CF_DIB).

[13/04/94]	RS	raswin.c
		Improved the processing of WM_SIZE handling by increasing
		XRange to be long aligned rather than decreasing it. This
		avoids the occasional black line down the side of the screen.

[13/04/94]	RS	transfor.c
		Corrected bug in transfor.c that cleared more entries in
		in the StructShade table than there were. This sometimes
		caused RasMol to crash later during keyword lookup.

[12/04/94]	RS	rasmol.c
		Changed the TERMIOS handling section to support FreeBSD1.1
		using XFree2.x. Special thanks to Pedro A M Vazquez.

[11/04/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Corrected bug in RasMol that caused residues with different
		insertion codes to be placed in the same group. They're now
		placed in consecutive Groups but with the same serial number
		hence may be "renumbered". Thanks to Anne Cleasby.

[07/04/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Corrected bug in sizing molecule read from an MDL Mol file.

[05/04/94]	RS	molecule.c molecule.h command.c tokens.h raswin.c 
		rasmol.c
		Added support for reading in files in Molecular Design Ltd's
		(MDL) Mol file format.

[30/03/94]	RS	rasmol.doc
		Corrected HTML bug that caused the NCSA PC Mosiaic viewer to
		crash when displaying rasmol.html.

[28/03/94]	RS	pixutils.c
		Corrected a bug in RenderPolygon that caused a floating point
		division by zero error and huge/far segment problems on the 
		IBM PC.

[25/03/94]	RS	outfile.c
		Finished implementing correctly intersecting spheres when
		outputing vector postscript. However, this may cause
		problems for low memory laser printers.

[23/03/94]	RS	transfor.c
		Corrected bug that set the default scale too large for very
		small molecules.

[22/03/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Handle incompletely specificed @<TRIPOS>MOLECULE records in
		Sybyl Mol2 files such as those exported from InSight. Handle
		`small molecule' atom names (containing serial numbers) in 
		PDB files. Thanks to Martin Hargreaves

[18/03/94]	RS	pixutils.c
		Improved the polygon rendering algorithm. RasMol now displays
		solid ribbons as gouraud rather than constant normal shaded
		polygons.

[18/03/94]	RS	rasmol.c
		Added the command line options "-pdb", "-alchemy", "-mol2"
		and "-xyz" to specify the format of the file given on the
		command line.

[17/03/94]	RS	molecule.h command.h
		Increased the maximum filename length from 80 to 256 chars.

[15/03/94]	RS	outfile.c outfile.c command.c
		Improved the quality of "vectps" output. RasMol now correctly
		handles intersection of spheres in vector PostScript output.
		The use of `cartoon' outlines is now controlled by the
		"set vectps <boolean>" command.

[14/03/94]	RS	x11win.c
		Change Visual detection code for 24bit and 32bit displays to
		support both TrueColor and DirectColor. This adds support for
		the HP 735 CRX-24. Special Thanks to Thomas Lew.

[11/03/94]	RS	outfile.c
		Improved speed of vector PostScript printing by performing
		sphere and bond culling before sorting/generating output.

[11/03/94]	RS	molecule.c molecule.h command.c tokens.h raswin.c
		Added support for MSC XMOL's XYZ format files.

[10/03/94]	RS	molecule.c molecule.h command.c tokens.h raswin.c
		Added support for Sybyl .mol2 file format for reading in
		a file (i.e. "load mol2"). Read small molecule connectivity
		from "alchemy" and "mol2" files, if it exists.

[09/03/94]	RS	x11win.c
		Allow the EIGHTBIT version of RasMol to display on 8-bit
		grey-scale X displays. Special thanks to Gerald Loeffler.

[09/03/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Allow backbone traces to be drawn to unknown residues
		that contain an alpha carbon.

[04/03/94]	RS	!Announced the public release of RasMol and 
		RasWin version 2.3, available by anonymous FTP from 
		ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk [129.215.160.5] in the directory 
		/pub/rasmol. The announcement was made in both 
		bionet.software, bionet.announce, sci.bio,
		sci.chem, comp.graphics.visualisation newsgroups.
