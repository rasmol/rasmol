[25/10/94]	RS	molecule.c molecule.h command.c abstree.h
		Once again improved the method rasmol uses to determine
		bonding by maintaining the covalent radius of every element.
		The "connect <boolean>" command has been implemented.

[24/10/94]	RS	rasmac.c molecule.c outfile.c script.c
		Associated a file creator, a file type and an icon with all
		of RasMac's output files; clicking on kinemage output starts
		Mage. Fixed compatability problem with metrowerks C compiler. 

[24/10/94]	RS	raswin.c mswin31.c command.c transfor.c render.c

		Microsoft Windows. Added command line options to raswin.

[24/10/94]	RS	rasmac.c rasmac.rsrc
		Added the ability to detect a file's type information when
		using apple events. Also added handing of 'mMOL' signature
		used by MDL's MOL files. This allows Mol files and RasMol
		scripts to be treated sensibly when dragged & dropped.

[20/11/94]	RS	x11win.c
		Added an XQueryExtension test to OpenDials to avoid problems
		on servers that don't understand XInputExtension. Changed
		MITSHM to use XQueryExtension rather than the undocumented
		XShmQueryExtension call. Fixed MacX popup menu problem.

[20/11/94]	RS	transfor.c transfor.h command.c tokens.h
		Implemented the RasMol "colour dots potential command".

		TokenValue a Long, this corrects bug in over zooming.
		Forced function prototypes on Macs as well as ansi C & PCs

[07/10/94]	RS	x11win.c
		Provided (compromise) better support for 32/24bit X displays
		that are not RasMol endian, this displays images correctly
		on the screen but generates incorrect raster files!

[06/10/94]	RS	script.c command.c command.h
		Added file format to the load statement and added UNIX style
		scripting comment to the generated RasMol scripts.

[06/10/94]	RS	command.c command.h
		Fixed bug in RasMac that caused file names to be converted 
		to upper case and truncated at the first space [like RasWin].

[06/10/94]	RS	Imakefile rasmol.h command.c rasmol.c
		Improved the RasMol Imakefile. Added much better support
		for HP-UX version 9.x. Special thanks to Richard Lloyd.

[06/10/94]	RS	render.h
		Fixed Ribbons bug caused by isqrt on sun386i machines!

[28/09/94]	RS	applemac.c

		on screens with less than 256 colours.

[26/09/94]	RS	rasmac.c applemac.c
		Reorganised mouse movement processing using null events similar
		to the Windows version. Implemented all 'MouseMode's using the
		option and command keys. Added 'Edit' Menu to main Menu.

[26/09/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Treat 'END' records identically to 'TER' records, allowing PDB
		files to be concatenated. 

[23/09/94]	RS	rasmol.h
		Fixed a problem with the "ToUpper" macro on the Evans and 
		Sutherland ESV caused by non-ansi C compiler (like sun386i).

[23/09/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Made several changes to the processing of PDB files. TER
		now forces a split between chains (with identical chain idents)
		Protein mainchain hydrogen bonding only within a single chain.

[23/09/94]	RS	x11win.c
		Extended RasMol's handling of dials boxes to allow the use of
		Silicon Graphics' "Absolute" mode dials box. This fixes several
		usability problems. Thanks to Steve Jordan.

[22/09/94]	RS	abstree.c
		Made '#' synonymous to the wildcard '?' in atom names.

[22/09/94]	RS	script.c
		No longer comment out the load command in scripts generated 
		by the "write script" command. Thanks to Paul Charifson.

[16/09/94]	RS	tokens.h transfor.h transfor.c command.c
		Introduced the colour scheme "charge". This is identical
		to temperature except high values are blue, low are red.

[16/09/94]	RS	graphics.h applemac.c transfor.c
		Corrected bug in 32bit RasMol when using more than 256 
		colours, e.g. "colour group". Implemented 32bit Mac version.

[15/09/94]	RS	x11win.c
		Finally corrected problem with colour map flashing on SGI
		Personal Iris Machines caused by Enter & Leave Notification.
		Deleted unused functions "AllocSharedMem" and "FreeSharedMem".

[15/09/94]	RS	rasmac.c applemac.c render.c command.c command.h
		Ported RasMol to compile on both the Apple Machintosh 
		and the PowerPC (native) using the Metrowerks C compiler. 

[15/09/94]	RS	abstree.h abstree.c
		Revised the Van der Waals radii for all the elements in
		the periodic table. Atomic symbol 'Lw' is same as 'Lr'.

[14/09/94]	RS	command.c
		Added the function FetchFloat to allow the user to specify
		real (fixed point) values. All commands taking distances in
		RasMol units (including "set radius" and "within") may now 
		also specify real values in Angstroms. "Slab", "zoom", 
		"rotate" and "translate" may also take non-integral values.

[14/09/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Extended RasMol's handling of CONECT records using the 
		'pseudo-convention' that double and triple bonds are
		specified twice and three times respectively. Thanks to
		Jeff Blaney and Dave Weinenger.

[14/09/94]	RS	command.c
		Improved the syntax of RasMol atom expressions. It is now
		possible to specify a chain after a residue number or range
		of residue numbers, e.g. select 5-8:a, 4b, 1:1, 6:*

[14/09/94]	RS	script.c script.h
		Modified the algorithm used for outputing bonds (including
		backbone, hbonds and ssbonds) in WriteRasMolScript. This
		significantly reduces size of some resulting script files.
		Also corrected a bug outputing scripts containing ribbons.

[11/09/94]	RS	rasmac.c applemac.c RasMac.rsrc
		Completed initial port of RasMol to the Apple Machintosh.
		All that remains to be done are the apple specific dialog
		boxes and apple events.

[01/09/94]	RS	command.c
		Corrected a bug in LoadFile that caused the file depth to
		be reset. This resulted in `DisplaySelectCount' showing
		the result of each operation in a RasMol script.

[01/09/94]	RS	script.c script.h outfile.c outfile.h
		Split the RasMol module "outfile", to produce a new module
		"script" responsible for generating script like output
		files. This avoids the 32K per segment limit on the Apple
		Machintosh.

[09/08/94]	RS	transfor.c
		Corrected bug in CPKColourAttrib that assumed there were 
		only seven CPK colours. This caused compounds containing
		heavy atoms to be displayed in the wrong colour.

[09/08/94]	RS	pixutils.c
		Corrected two bugs that were producing incorrectly drawn
		vectors. The first in ClipVector resulted in lines never 
		being partially clipped, the other a bug in DrawTwinVector.

[08/08/94]	RS	outfile.c
		Improved quality of MolScript and Kinemage output files.

[04/08/94]	RS	transfor.c transfor.h render.c
		Improved implementation of shadowing using the fact that
		the inverse of a general rotation matrix is its transpose.
		This should improve the RasMol critical path!

[02/08/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Implemented the function ReadPDBCoord to allow RasMol to
		read in Chem3D format PDB files. Thanks to Henry Rzepa.

[02/08/94]	RS	command.c
		Disabled the use of "save" and "write" commands in RasMol
		scripts. This avoids security problems when used with the
		internet. Thanks to Martin Hargreaves and Ian Dunkin.

[01/08/94]	RS	Makefile
		Fixed problem that resulted in getpwnam only searching the
		local /etc/passwd and not NIS. Thanks to Mike Hann.

[27/07/94]	RS	abstree.h abstree.c command.c
		Added element name to periodic table to allow the use
		of element names, and their corresponding plurals, as 
		predefined set names containg all elements of that type.
		For example, "select chlorines" and "select zinc".

[22/07/94]	RS	raswin.c
		Implemented "Drag & Drop" functionality in RasWin.

[20/07/94]	RS	font.h pixutils.c pixutils.h render.c command.c tokens.h
		Implemented prototype atom labelling in RasMol. The commands
		"label <string>", "colour label <colour>" and "set fontsize 
		<value>" are all implemented. Needs more work on label
		placement, clipping and optimisations.

[14/07/94]	RS	rasmol.c
		Extended cursor key mappings in to handle DEC and ANSI control
		sequences for cursor keys in application mode.

[14/07/94]	RS	abstree.c abstree.h transfor.c transfor.h render.c molecule.c
		Completed support for entire periodic table of elements. This
		now uses a single structure for VdW radius and CPK colours.
		The property "elemno" now specifies the atom's atomic number.

[11/07/94]	RS	tokens.h command.c
		Made the keyword 'source' synonymous with 'script', and 
		the keyword 'mainchain' synonymous with the predefined 
		set backbone.

[08/07/94]	RS	tokens.h command.c molecule.c
		Introduced the command 'connect' to force RasMol to
		determine the bonding of the current molecule.

[29/06/94]	RS	molecule.c
		Corrected bug in LoadPDBMolecule that resulted in CONECT
		records from Pat Walter's "babel" being misinterpreted.

[24/06/94]	RS	outfile.c
		Improved the quality of stick bonds in Vector PostScript by 
		shading them by their angle to the viewer.

[23/06/94]	RS	outfile.c rasmol.doc
		Corrected problem in WriteScriptFile that resulted in 
		syntax errrors in RasMol script files describing hydrogen
		(and disuplhide) bonding patterns. Thanks to Martti Tolvanen.

[17/06/94]	RS	command.c
		Introduced the file format "RasMol" to the write command
		which is equivalent to the "Script" format specifier.

[14/06/94]	RS	raswin.c
		Corrected minor bug that caused the About dialog box in 
		Windows NT not to display the processor type. Special
		thanks to Pedro Mendes.

[13/06/94]	RS	rasmol.doc manual.doc manual.ps
		Corrected Dreiding spelling mistake in rasmol.doc and fixed
		problem with manual.ps caused by a bug in the PostScript
		printer driver supplied by Microsoft.

[09/06/94]	RS	!Announced the public release of RasMol and RasWin 
		version 2.4, available by anonymous FTP from ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk
		[129.215.160.5] in the directory /pub/rasmol. The announcement
		was made in bionet.software, bionet.announce, sci.bio,
		sci.chem, comp.graphics.visualisation, bionet.xtallography
		and sci.techniques.xtallography newsgroups.
