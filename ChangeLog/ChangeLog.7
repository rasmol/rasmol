[10/10/96]	RS	render.c
		Fixed bug in ReSize screen that incorrectly set MaxZoom. This
		should match the code in InitialTransform().  Special Thanks
		to Tim Maffet.

[10/10/96]	RS	pixutils.c
		Correct bug testing incorrect OutCode in routine ClipLine().
		Special thanks to Tim Maffet.

[07/10/96]	RS	raswin.c
		Changed the style and class of the command line window to 
		allow it to be minimized in Windows 95.  Thanks to Ken Davis.

[30/09/96]	RS	render.c
		Fixed a bug displaying crystallographic unit cell. Very
		Special Thanks to Wei Dong <wei@chem.gla.ac.uk>

[24/09/96]	RS	 rasmol.c
		Add support for several command line options including
		"-width", "-height", "-noconnect" and "-port".  Special
		thanks to Ryan Hung for the WidthxHeight code.

[23/09/96]	RS	command.c
		Modified the FetchFile function to trap SIGPIPE when calling
		popen(3) to gunzip or decompress. Thanks to Guy Slater.

[17/07/96]	RS	 command.c
		Fixed a bug in RasWin under Windows 95 that prevents 
		filenames from containing spaces.  Thanks to Bob Long.

[16/07/96]	RS	transfor.c
		Improved the implementation of ScaleColourMap that no
		longer uses floating point values.  This fixes problems
		on IBM PC and improves performance.

[16/07/96]	RS	command.c
		Add the "set sequence <boolean>" command to RasMol and
		implemented "DescribeSequence" that controls whether "show
		sequence" displays three-letter or one-letter amino codes.

[16/07/96]	RS	pixutils.c
		Fixed 16bit overflow problem when display polygons in 
		RasWin in routines "DrawPolygon" and "ClipPolygon".

[02/07/96]	RS	x11win.c
		Fixed a bug in RasMol that treated the SGI NumLock key as
		an Alt-modifier.  Popping up menus when typing into the
		canvas window.  Thanks to Andrew Leach and Ryan Smith.

[01/07/96]	RS	rasmac.c
		Corrected problems in "OpenDialogHook" and "SaveDialogHook"
		that caused several problems including a system crash when
		running Symmantec Directory Assistance II.  Special Thanks
		to Kevin E. Gilbert (for the patch) and Henry Rzepa (for
		discovering the problem).

[07/05/96]	RS	command.c
		Corrected bug in "ExecuteSetCommand" that caused "set backfade"
		to always reset "set transparency" (a missing break statement).
		Special Thanks to Tim Maffett.

[09/04/96]	RS	script.c
		Modified the generation of script files to fix a bug in
		writing the "colour axes" command to include commas. Special
		to Guy Slater.

[29/03/96]	RS	script.c
		Modified the generation of script files to avoid writing
		"colour ribbons none" at each residue, which is the default.
		Thanks to Alan Lewis.

[21/11/95]	RS	command.c
		Changed the conditions in FetchFile on when RasMol determines
		bonds itself to the condition "bonds < atoms-chains".  This
		allows multiple connected fragments.  Thanks to William Hart.

[10/11/95]	RS	infile.c x11win.c
		Made several #ifdef VMS changes to allow RasMol to compile
		with VAX C.  Thanks to Gail Schuman.

[10/11/95]	RS	pixutils.h pixutils.c repres.c
		Changed the field names hx, hy and hz in structure Knot to
		to dx, dy and dz to avoid clash with predefined AIX macro hz.
		Thanks to Hiroki Morizono.

[09/11/95]	RS	transfor.c
		Fixed bug in ApplyTransform() that caused RasMol to crash if
		all atoms have the same co-ordinates. Thanks to Guy Slater.

[06/11/95]	RS	script.c
		Fixed bug in RasMol script generation that outputs the
		background colour before the zap command (which resets
		the background colour to black). Thanks to Niels Kristian 
		Bech Jensen.

[20/10/95]	RS	infile.c
		Fixed bug in RasMol CHARMm file format reader.  RasMol now
		uses the standard PDB residue numbering in column 56, rather
		than the sequential numbering in column 5.  Thanks to Milan
		Hodoscek
