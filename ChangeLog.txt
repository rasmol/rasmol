  Changes from RasMol 2.7.2.1.1 (the final reference release of RasMol 2.7.2) to RasMol 2.7.3.1
  include:

     * Adjustment to the mouse handling for a better, more natural feel. Our thanks to C.
       Chigbo for the suggestion.
     * Correction to cif.c for blanks after an initial quote mark.
     * Correction to mswin31.c to restore lost initializations of ZRange and
       DialValue[8..9].
     * Modifications by Mamoru Yamanishi to Imakefile and rasmol.c to use xforms for GUI
       file open. This patch needs the opens source xforms 1.0.90 library by Steve Lamont.
     * Correction to molecule.c to correct input of xyz files. Thanks to Stuart Prescott.
     * Revision to CPK colors by C. Chigbo. The new colors are called CPKNEW. The current
       CPK colors remain available as CPK.
     * Correction to negative torsion angle monitors and to imprecise distance and angle
       monitors by C. Chigbo. This patch corrects the display of negative torsion angles
       caused by use of the unsigned short type, and correctys imprecise distance and angle
       displays. This extends the original patch which was just for torsion angles
       (torsion.patch). A side effect of this change is to limit the available range for
       distance monitors to approximately 327 AAngstroms.
     * Initial code for display of solid Lee-Richards molecular surfaces. This patch adds
       the basic code for display of Lee-Richards surfaces with a new Molecular Surface menu
       item, and surface molecule <probe radius> and surface solvent <probe radius>
       commands.
     * Corrections of ribbons 0, etc. commands by R. Chachra. With this patch, the wireframe
       0, ribbon 0, cartoon 0, backbone 0, strands 0 and trace 0 commands work the same as
       these command with off instead of 0.

                 multiple bonds: PickBond.   Allowed picking parameter shift = -1
                 when Ctrl key is down to deselect an atom (a group, a chain)
                 from the current selection. [Note by HJB 02/04/01 -- The UCB
                 and 2.7.2 bond picking was used in 2.7.2.1 instead of the

  Changes adapted from UCB rasmol in creating RasMol 2.7.2:

   Note: These mods do not reflect the complete source of UCB RasMol. In particular
   toolbar.h and toolbar.c have not been used in this pass, and the full source of UCB
   RasMol has not yet been recovered.

 [30/11/95]    GSG rasmac.c
                 Hide command window.  Add help screen menu logic.  Add hooks to
                 load multiple molecules.  Add toolbar menu to Windows menu.  Make
                 mouse moves control bond rotation, molecule rotation or world
                 rotation depending on tool bar button choices.  Same for scroll
                 bars.

 [29/11/95]    GSG       applemac.c
                 Change default background for printing to white.
                 Hook scroll bar H values to bond angle (BRotValue),
                 molecule rotation angle (DialValue[1]) or
                 world rotation angle (WRotValue[1]) depending on
                 toolbar settings.  Hook scroll bar V values to
                 molecule rotation angle (DialValue[0]) or
                 world rotation angle (WRotValue[0]) depending on
                 tool bar settings.  Allow file open when less than
                 MAX_MOLECULES molecules.

 [21/08/00]    GSG       font.h
                 Add characters for Angstrom and degree as replacements
                 for vertical bar and tilde.

                 Add PickBond.  Add hooks to draw multiple molecules.  Automatically
                 switch to the molecule of any picked atom.  Add monitor for picked
                 distance, angle or torsion angle.

 [14/11/95]    GSG transfor.c
                 Add hooks for bond rotation and global rotation.

 [14/11/95]    GSG vector.c, vector.h, wbrotate.c, wbrotate.h
                 New routines introduced with UCB mods to allow for
                 bond rotations and global rotation.

 [14/11/95]    GSG infile.c
                 Add fxorg, fyorg, fxorg for MDL molecule input only.

 [14/11/95]    GSG molecule.c, molecule.h
                 Add fxorg, fyorg, fxorg and list of bonds to atom database
                 for world and bond rotation.

 [11/11/95]    GSG multiple.c, multiple.h
                 New routine introduced with UCB mods to allow for

  Changes from RasMol 2.7.1 to create RasMol 2.7.1.1:

 [21/01/01]    FGR, HJB  langsel.c, langsel_mac.c, mswin.c,  applemac.c
                 Installed translations for Edit menu on mac and PC
                 provided by Fernando Gabriel Ranea.

 [17/01/01]    FGR, HJB  langsel.c, langsel_mac.c
                 Corrections to translations by Fernando Gabriel Ranea, installed
                 by HJB with revisions to menu bar accelerators.

 [12/01/01]    HJB       applemac.c
                 Added include of langsel.h.  Added routine ReWriteStr255 to rewrite
                 menu bar items in place and tostr255 to convert other menu items
                 strings to Pascal form for use in SetmenuItemText.  Set up
                 ReDrawWindow to refresh all menu strings and then redraw the menu
                 bar.  Note that the rewrite of the main menu bar is _very_ risky
                 and may not survive system changes.

 [12/01/01]    HJB       command.c
                 Added include of langsel.h.  Remove redundant ErrorMsg array and Err...
                 definitions.  Change messages to reference MsgStrs.  Add English and
                 Spanish as commands calling SwitchLang.

 [12/01/01]    HJB       infile.c
                 Fix coordinate typo in load of XYZ and Mol2 molecules.

 [12/01/01]    HJB       langsel.c, langsel_mac.c, langsel.h
                 New routines to carry multi-lingual translations.  Many thanks to
                 Fernando Gabriel Ranea for the bulk of the Spanish translations,
                 and for creating the initial Spanish version of RasMol 2.7.1.  Note
                 that langsel.c uses the ANSI character set, while lansel_mac.c uses the
                 Macintosh character set.

 [12/01/01]    HJB       molecule.c
                 Added include of langsel.h.  Changed messages to reference MsgStrs.
                 Refixed D2O misparse, which had been previously fixed.  Mod had been
                 lost.

 [12/01/01]    HJB       mswin31.c
                 Added include of raswin.idm and langsel.h.  Included partial update
                 to printer logic.  Added ReDrawWindow as rewrite of menus with
                 ModifyMenu and RemoveMenu/AppendMenu calls.

 [12/01/01]    HJB       rasmac.c
                 Added include of langsel.h.  Added SwitchLang(English) calls
                 for initialization to main routine.

 [12/01/01]    HJB       rasmol.c
                 Add fix for broken math routines by referencing atan2.

 [12/01/01]    HJB       rasmol.h
                 Added include of langsel.h.  Added SwitchLang(English) calls
                 for initialization to main routine.

 [12/01/01]    HJB       raswin.c
                 Added include of langsel.h.  Changed font of command window to ANSI
                 character set.  Changed most messages to reference MsgStrs.  Add
                 SwitchLang(English) calls for initialization to WinMain.

 [12/01/01]    HJB       x11win.c
                 Restructured MenuItem and BarItem to make .text, .pos and .len
                 indirect, so that they can be fetched from MsgStrs, MsgAuxl and
                 MsgLens.  The .pos field is used to specify the character offset
                 of the acceleration key.  The main menu bar may now have non-zero
                 offsets.  All the menu items have been changed to MsgStrs[StrM...]
                 referecences, and added include of langsel.h.  Added ReDrawWindow
                 simply as a call to ReSizeWindow.  This is overkill, but appropriate
                 for these infrequent calls.

 [12/01/01]    HJB       tokens.h
                 Added tokens EnglishTok and SpanishTok.

 [12/01/01]    HJB       graphics.h
                 Added prototype of ReDrawWindow, a system-dependent call to be used
                 after updating menus on language changes.

 [12/01/01]    HJB       cmndline.c
                 Added include of langsel.h, changed prompts as follows:

                 "PDB file name:"                MsgStrs[StrPrmtPDB]
                 "Image file name:"              MsgStrs[StrPrmtImg]
                 "Molecule file name:"   MsgStrs[StrPrmtMol]



 [12/01/01]    HJB       tokens.c
                 Added the following tokens:
