   The original RasMol manual was created by Roger Sayle. In July 1996, Dr. Margaret
   Wong of the Chemistry Department, Swinburne University of Technology, Australia,
   made extensive revisions to the RasMol 2.5 manual to accurately reflect the
   operation of RasMol 2.6. Eric Martz of the University of Massachusetts made further
   revisions. In May 1997, William McClure of Carnegie Mellon University reorganized
   the HTML version of the manual into multiple sections which could be downloaded
   quickly and added use of frames. Portions of the 2.7.1 version of the RasMol manual
   were derived with permission from William McClure's version using Roger Sayle's
   rasmol.doc for version 2.6.4 as the primary source. Changes were made in August 2000
   for RasMol version 2.7.2, January 2001 for RasMol version 2.7.1.1 and April 2001 for
   RasMol version 2.7.2.1 and February 2005 for RasMol version 2.7.3.

                                       Translations

   Thanks to the efforts of Jose Miguel Fernandez Fernandez (Departamento de Bioquimica
   y Biologia Molecular. Universidad de Granada. Espana (jmfernan@ugr.es)) a
   translation of the Manual for Rasmol version 2.7.1 into Spanish is now available. La
   traduccion espanola del manual de la version de la Dra. Wong revisada por Eric Martz
   fue realizada por Isabel Servan Martinez y Jose Miguel Fernandez Fernandez. La
   actual traduccion del Manual de RasMol 2.7.1 ha sido realizada usando como base la
   anterior de RasMol 2.6 por  Jose Miguel Fernandez Fernandez.

   Thanks to translations by Fernando Gabriel Ranea <davinci@dinamica.com.ar> in late
   2000 and early 2001, RasMol is now capable of rendering most menu items and messages
   in Spanish. Jean-Pierre Demailly <Jean-Pierre.Demailly@ujf-grenoble.fr> provided
   French translations of menus and messages in January 2001. Giuseppe Martini
   <martini@iigb.na.cnr.it> and Giovanni Paolella <paolella@dbbm.unina.it> with
   contributions by A. Davassi, M. Masullo and C. Liotto provided Italian translation
   of menus and messages in March 2001.

  Obtaining RasMol v2.7.5

   In order to install RasMol, you may start with a compiled binary or work from the
   source code.

   The complete source code and user documentation of RasMol 2.7.5 may be obtained from
   http://blondie.dowling.edu/projects/rasmol and
   http://blondie.dowling.edu/projects/rasmol. and by anonymous FTP at:

   ftp://ftp.bernstein-plus-sons.com/software/RasMol_2.7.5.tar.gz

   or on the web at:

   http://www.bernstein-plus-sons.com/software/RasMol_2.7.5.tar.gz

   As compiled version become available, they will be posted at
   http://blondie.dowling.edu/projects/rasmol and
   http://blondie.dowling.edu/projects/rasmol.

   To transfer by anonymous ftp, type "ftp ftp.bernstein-plus-sons.com" on the command
   line. Several seconds later you'll be prompted for a username. Use the username
   "anonymous" and when asked for a password enter your e-mail address. Once logged in,
   type the command "cd software/rasmol" to change the directory to /software/rasmol
   and then type "binary" to avoid corrupting the files during the transfer. For each
   file you wish to transfer, type "get <filename>" and when you've finished type
   "quit". If these files are subsequently transfered to other machines, please
   remember to transfer them in BINARY mode. The file sizes should be identical before
   and after the transfer.

   NOTE: The Mac uses the "carriage return" character to signify the end of a line,
   while UNIX machines use a "linefeed". If a file is transfered between these two
   machines in "ASCII" mode all such characters are exchanged, thereby corrupting the
   archive. Please ensure that you type the FTP command "binary" before you transfer
   the file, indicating that the file should be transfered without translation.

   If you wish to start from source code, you will need a RasMol source kit, and you
   may need one or more external packages that are not part of RasMol, but which are
   used by RasMol.

   To build/rebuild RasMol 2.7.5 on any platform, you'll need to transfer the following
   file:

   RasMol.tar.gz UNIX 'tar'ed 'gzip'ped archive containing the complete source code and 
                 documentation of the RasMol molecular graphics package.                

   To unpack the file on a UNIX machine type the command "gunzip RasMol.tar.gz" and
   then the command "tar -xvf RasMol.tar" to extract the files in a subdirectory under
   the current directory.

         *** IMPORTANT CHANGE IN INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR RELEASE 2.7.5 ***

   You will either need to have the following packages installed in your system, or to
   ensure that the indicated defines are at the start Imakefile:

     * http://downloads.sf.net/neartree/NearTree-2.1.3.tar.gz or
       #define NEARTREE_LOCAL

     * http://downloads.sf.net/cqrlib/CQRlib-1.0.3.tar.gz or
       #define CQRLIB_LOCAL

       http://http://downloads.sf.net/cvector/CVector-1.0.3.tar.gz or
       #define CVECTOR_LOCAL

     * http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases-noredirect/xforms/xforms-1.0.91.tar.gz
       or
       #define XFORMSLIB_LOCAL

     * http://downloads.sf.net/cbflib/CBFlib-0.8.1.tar.gz or
       #define CBFLIB_LOCAL

   In addition, depending on what has already been installed on your system, you may
   need one or more of certain font kits. These packages are not part of RasMol and
   normally whould be obtained from their primary web sites, but, for convenience in
   installing RasMol, they have been gathered in the external_packages module in the
   CVS and as the External_Packages release on
   http://blondie.dowling.edu/projects/rasmol and
   http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/openrasmol.

   These font kits are snapshots of the versions in use at the time of the build of
   RasMol 2.7.5. The primary developer web site for each package should be consulted
   for the latest versions. Because these kits may not be the same as later, standard
   versions that are used by the system, as a whole, scripts in RasMol that use thses
   kits (especially font kits) assume that each kit has been unpacked to a directory
   _within_ the RasMol build directory, at the same level as the src directory.

   For RasMol release 2.7.5 the package snapshots other than the font kits have been
   replaced by the table of downloads listed above.

   For building for MS Windows, do not try to use Visual Studio. Use MINGW instead.

   You will need both an appropriate binary and a copy of rasmol.hlp for each system,
   and, under Windows, a copy of raswin.hlp for the WinHelp sub-system.

   On an SGI, rename the appropriate binary as rasmol and copy it to
   /usr/local/bin/rasmol (or to some appropriate location specified by the environment
   variable PATH) and copy rasmol.hlp to /usr/local/lib/rasmol/rasmol.hlp (or to the
   location indicated by the environment variable RASMOLPATH)

     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Installing RasMol v2.7.5

    UNIX X11:

   If you are using a precompiled binary, see the instructions that are provided with
   the binary kit. In general, the binary kits for unix provided directly by this
   project are tarballs of the $HOME/lib/RasMol_2_7_5 created by running the script in
   src/rasmol_install.sh. The MS windows kit is a NSIS installer to be double-clicked
   after downloading.
    1. Fonts: Followling the instructions for your system, install whatever X11 font
       packages you need to the language variants of RasMol you intend to use. Almost
       all Unix variants come with the appropriate fonts for English, French, Spanish
       and Italian. There is an appropriate cyrillic font package,
       cyr-rfx-windows-1251-1.1, in external_packages. The Chinese and Japanese fonts
       in intlfonts-1.2.1.tar.gz in external_pakages seem to be satisfactory.
    2. In the RasMol src directory, either
          * Modify the #defines in the file rasmol.h (see below) Note: IBMPC should not
            be defined.
          * either
               * Use the script rasmol_build_options.sh to build a new Imakefile from
                 Imakefile_base. The valid options are:
                 {--help|-h}
                 {--cbflib_local}
                 {--cqrlib_local}
                 {--cvector_local}
                 {--neartree_local}
                 {--xformslib_local}
                 {--use_xformslib}
                 {--use_gtk}
                 {--pixeldepth=32}
                 {--pixeldepth=16}
                 {--pixeldepth=8}
                 {--macosx_fink}

                 or
               * Edit Imakefile to change the desired options by hand. Use of
                 rasmol_build_options.sh is in general perferred
          * either
               * execute
                  &npsp;xmkmf
                 and
               * execute
                  &npsp;make rasmol
            or
               * edit the script build_all.sh
               * excute build_all.sh
            to build as many variants of rasmol as possible.
          * A common problem is that SUN OpenWindows keeps its include files in the
            directory /usr/openwin/include/X11, hence the compiler directive
            -I/usr/openwin/include must be added to CFLAGS.
          * A common problem on IBM RS6000s running AIX is that the MIT shared memory
            extensions to X windows are in the library -lXextSam, hence this must be
            added to the LIBS lines in either the Makefile or Imakefile.

    MS Windows:

            If you are using a precompiled binary, follow the instructions that come
            with the binary, but in general, you either need to place raswin.exe,
            rasmol.hlp and raswin.hlp into the directory from which you will run, or
            you need to execute the installer program by double clicking it.

            If you are building from source, you will need MINGW, not visual studio.
            CodeWarrior version 9 can also be used.

    Macintosh under OSX:

            Follow the instructions for unix and run under the X11 system. A pre-edited
            version of the build_all.sh script called build_MACOSX.sh is provided.

  COMPILATION DIRECTIVES

            The file rasmol.h contains a number of #define directives that control the
            runtime behaviour of the program. The following directives may be defined
            or undefined to suite the local site.

            THIRTYTWOBIT This determines whether RasMol will display and produce 8bit,  
            SIXTEENBIT   16bit or 32(24) bit output. By default the symbol EIGHTBIT is  
            EIGHTBIT     defined producing images with up to 256 colours. This symbol   
                         must be defined if IBMPC is defined.                           
            DIALBOX      This enables the use of a dials box, that is connected using   
                         the X Window System XInput extension. This option requires     
                         that the program be compiled with the Xi and Xext libraries.   
                         Note: libXi is called libXinput on some old machines, so       
                         requires the compiler option -lXinput!                         
            MITSHM       This option enables the use of the X Window System MIT shared  
                         memory extension. This enables images to be displayed faster   
                         when RasMol and the X11 server are running on the same host.   
                         This option requires the program be compiled with the Xext     
                         library. On IBM RS6000s runnning AIX, MITSHM also requires the 
                         XextSam library (which requires changing the Makefile or       
                         Imakefile). This is now enabled by default. This should be     
                         disabled on E&S ESV workstations as MITSHM support is not      
                         provided as standard.                                          
            TERMIOS      This directive enables the command line processing on UNIXs    
                         that support the termios terminal handling routines. By        
                         leaving this symbol undefined, RasMol omits the interactive    
                         command line interface. Undefining is not recommended!         
            SOCKETS      This directive enables the TCP/IP server functionality of      
                         RasMol to be enable. This enables other software to connect to 
                         a running RasMol. This should be undefined on machines not     
                         supporting BSD-style TCP/IP sockets (such as VMS).             
            APPLEMAC     This determines whether the program is to run on an Apple      
                         Macintosh or PowerMac. By default, this option is disabled.    
                         The Macintosh code may be compiled to be either EIGHTTBIT or   
                         THIRTYTWOBIT and will generate images effectively.             
            IBMPC        This determines whether the program is intended to run on an   
                         IBM PC or compatible. By default, this option is disabled.     
            MSWIN        This determines whether the program is intended to run on an   
                         IBM PC or compatible under MS Windows. By default, this option 
                         is disabled.                                                   
            PROFILE      Defining PROFILE enables code to profile RasMol execution.     
            XPROCARCH    Defining XPROCARCH enables code for raswin that gets detailed  
                         information about the operating system and processor           
            USE_UNAME    Defining USE_UNAME enables code for rasmol under X11 that gets 
                         detailed information about the operating system and processor. 
            USE_CBFLIB   Defining USE_CBFLIB enables code t that depends on CBFLIB for  
                         map reading and writing.                                       

            To summarise;

     A typical UNIX build:
          /* #define IBMPC        */
          /* #define MSWIN        */
          /* #define APPLEMAC     */

         #define USE_CBFLIB

     A typical Macintosh classic build:

         /* #define MSWIN         */
         #define APPLEMAC
         /* #define X11WIN        */
         /* #define UNIX          */
