<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
This document is an attempt to explain the historical context within
which the current thread of RasMol development is being done.  This is
a very narrow view of a very rich subject area.  For a broader view of
the history of molecular graphics, see the references to this note and
various web pages on the subject.
<P>

<H3>Historical Context</H3>
<P>
Pictures help in understanding the structure and function of
biologically significant molecules.  When individual atoms and bonds
are being considered, representations of bonds as sticks and atoms as
balls or as ellipsoids showing thermal librations are commonly used.   
When structure on a larger scale is being considered, renderings based
on stick bonds without explicit representations of atoms,
spaced-filling balls for atoms without explicit representations of
bonds, ribbons and curved tubes to represent polymeric backbones and
isoparametric surfaces coloured by the state of other parameters are
commonly used.  On either scale, electron density maps are useful.  The
small scale renderings were standardized in 1965 when Carroll
Johnson<FONT SIZE=1><SUP><A HREF="#footnote1">1</A></SUP></FONT>
created the Oak Ridge Thermal Ellipsoid Program, ORTEP, a computer
program that renders atoms as balls or ellipsoids connected by stick
bonds.  Cyrus Levinthal and Robert Langridge<FONT SIZE=1><SUP><A
HREF="#footnote2">2</A></SUP></FONT> used computer graphics for larger
scale renderings in structural biology.  In 1969, Irving Geis<FONT
SIZE=1><SUP><A HREF="#footnote3">3</A></SUP></FONT> set the standard
for hand-drawn, graphical renderings of the features of biological
macromolecules.  In the 1960's and 1970's computer generated graphics
gradually caught up with the standard set by Geis.  See the F. Scott
Mathews 1983 review<FONT SIZE=1><SUP><A
HREF="#footnote4">4</A></SUP></FONT>.  High quality graphical
representations of molecules became an essential element of scientific
research in structural biology.  In 1991, Kraulis<FONT SIZE=1><SUP><A
HREF="#footnote5">5</A></SUP></FONT> released Molscript, which, in
combination with Raster3D<FONT SIZE=1><SUP><A
HREF="#footnote6">6</A></SUP></FONT>, has become the standard for
high-quality renderings of macromolecules as static images.  In 1992,
the Richardsons released a Macintosh-based visualization program for
kinemages<FONT SIZE=1><SUP><A HREF="#footnote7">7</A></SUP></FONT> of
macromolecules.  In 1992, Roger Sayle<FONT SIZE=1><SUP><A
HREF="#footnote8">8</A></SUP></FONT> described the program RasMol,
which used a highly efficient rendering algorithm to allow high quality
interactive rendering of macromolecules on a wide variety of platforms.
 The program was released in 1993.  Roger Sayle's maintenance and
development of RasMol was supported by Glaxo for several years.
<P>
There are many other graphic rendering programs in use in structural
biology.  Swiss-PdbViewer<FONT SIZE=1><SUP><A
HREF="#footnote9">9</A></SUP></FONT> displays and manipulates multiple
models and electron density maps.   Raster3D<FONT SIZE=1><SUP><A
HREF="#footnote10">6</A>,</SUP></FONT><FONT SIZE=1><SUP><A
HREF="#footnote10">10</A>,</SUP></FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=1><A
HREF="#footnote11">11</A></FONT></SUP><FONT SIZE=1></FONT> provides a
powerful set of rendering tools for quality images of ribbons,
space-filling atoms, etc.  Molscript<FONT SIZE=1><SUP><A
HREF="#footnote12">12</A>13</SUP></FONT> is a rendering program both
for visualisation and export to other rendering programs, such as
Raster3D.   Molecular Simulations Inc. (MSI)  distributes WebLab
ViewerLite for free and sells WebLab ViewerPro for visualisation of
molecules on Macs and PCs (see
<A HREF="http://www.msi.com/life/products/weblab/viewer">http://www.msi.com/life/products/weblab/viewer</A>).   MDL Information
Systems, Inc (MDL) distributes Chemscape Chime, a derivative of RasMol
that works as a web browser &quot;plug-in&quot;.  In the late 1980's
UCSF Computer Graphics Laboratory's MIDAS <FONT SIZE=1><SUP><A
HREF="#footnote13">13</A></SUP></FONT> provided graphics tools for drug
design by visualisation and docking of molecules.  In the early 1990's
Anthony Nicholls' GRASP<FONT SIZE=1><SUP><A
HREF="#footnote14">14</A></SUP></FONT> brought a new level of rigor and
quality to visualisation of surfaces. 
<P>
Many of the programs mentioned in an historical context above have
continued to develop.  Ortep is alive and well with a new user-friendly
semi-interactive interface (see <A HREF="http://www.ornl.gov/ortep">http://www.ornl.gov/ortep</A>).  The
current descendant of MIDAS is Chimera (see
<A HREF="http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera">http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera</A>), which emphasizes extensibility. 
GRASP has been made highly accessible by a web server (GRASS, see
<A HREF="http://trantor.bioc.columbia.edu/GRASS/surfserv_enter.cgi">http://trantor.bioc.columbia.edu/GRASS/surfserv_enter.cgi</A>).  For
pointers to additional rendering programs, see the RCSB web page
(http://www.rcsb.org), and the IUCr web page (<A href="http://www.iucr.org">http://www.iucr.org</A>).

<H3>RasMol Developmental Threads</H3>
<P>
The RasMol 2 series began with the release of RasMol 2.1 in 1993 by
Roger Sayle.  In 1995 and 1995, Marco Molinaro modified Roger Sayle's
RasMol versions 2.5 and 2.6 to create 2.5-ucb and 2.6-ucb.  In late
1996, Roger Sayle release 2.6b2 which proved to be very popular and
durable.  Arne Mueller worked with Roger Sayle in 1998 and created a
modified version of 2.6b2 called 2.6x1, which was recently used as a
base for a version called 2.6ab2 by Andreas Bohne.  In late 1998,
Herbert Bernstein (the author of this review) modified 2.6b2 to create
the 2.6 CIF series.  At the same time Roger Sayle was completing his
own update to 2.6b2 called 2.6.4.  In early 1999, Roger Sayle, Arne
Mueller and Herbert Bernstein agreed to work together on a new, common,
open source version of RasMol, the 2.7 series, which is managed and
released by Herbert Bernstein.  As of this writing, versions 2.6.4,
2.6_CIF and 2.6x1 have all been integrated into the 2.7 series, and
agreement has been reached with Marco Molinaro and Andreas Bohne on
integration of their modifications into the main line of development.
A preliminary release incorporating some of the 2.5-ucb and 2.6-ucb
mods was released in August 2000.

</B></P>

<P>The new 2.7 series differs from the earlier version by being a
copyright-protected open source version.    Roger Sayle's earlier
versions were made freely available without restriction.  The new
series does have some restrictions.  The following conditions are
imposed on copying and distribution:
<P>
<DIR>
This version is based on RasMol version 2.6_CIF.2, on RasMol version
2.6x1 and on RasMol version 2.6.4. Please read the file NOTICE for
important notices which apply to this package. If you are not going to
make changes to RasMol, you are not only permitted to freely make
copies and distribute them, you are encouraged to do so, provided you
do the following:
<P>
<DIR>
1. Either include the complete documentation, especially the file
NOTICE, with what you distribute or provide a clear indication where
people can get a copy of the documentation; and
<P>
2. Please give credit where credit is due by citing the version and
original authors properly; and
<P>
3. Please do not give anyone the impression that the original authors
are providing a warranty of any kind.
</DIR>
<P>
If you would like to use major pieces of RasMol in some other program,
make modifications to RasMol, or in some other way make what a lawyer
would call a &quot;derived work&quot;, you are not only permitted to do
so, you are encouraged to do so. In addition to the things we discussed
above, please do the following:
<P>
<DIR>
4. Please explain in your documentation how what you did differs from
the version of RasMol you started with; and
<P>
5. Please make your modified source code available.
<P>
</DIR>
This version of RasMol is not in the public domain, but it is given
freely to the community in the hopes of advancing science. If you make
changes, please make them in a responsible manner, and please offer us
the opportunity to include those changes in future versions of
RasMol.
</DIR>
<BR>
<BR>
These conditions should help ensure the continued open source
development of RasMol for the indefinite future.  There may have been
some concern in the past that such &quot;open-source&quot; licensing
might discourage commercial use of the new versions of RasMol, but the
recent commercial successes of other open-source based efforts would
seem to indicate that such concerns are not to be taken as seriously as
they might once have been, and uses of RasMol in research and
instruction can only benefit from ensuring access to source code of the
full series.<BR>
<BR>
Roger Sayle's RasMol 2.6b2 is, arguably, the most popular variant of
RasMol.  It has been ported to almost all platforms used in structural
studies.  It allows the display and manipulation of a single molecule
as one rigid body.<BR>
<BR>
RasMol 2.5-ucb is a version of RasMol derived in 1995 from RasMol 2.5 by
Marco Molinaro of the MultiChem Facility at the University of
California, Berkeley (see <A HREF="http://mc2.cchem.berkeley.edu/RasMol">http://mc2.cchem.berkeley.edu/RasMol</A>).  It
was then upgraded to RasMol 2.6-ucb, based on RasMol 2.6.  The
MultiChem modified version of RasMol can display up to 5 molecules, and
can rotate portions of a molecule around a selected bond.  This is also
a very popular variant of RasMol.  However, until January 2000, this
version was been released only in binary form for Macs, PC's, Linux,
Ultrix and HP-UX.  As noted above, agreement has been reached to allow
the merging of these modifications into a future release of the common
open-source version, which should allow for wider user of these
features.<BR>
<BR>
Arne Mueller's RasMol 2.6x1 added the ability to calculate individual
torsion angles and Ramachandran plot data,  to show selected chains,
groups and atoms, to select by CIS bond angles, and added POV-Ray 3
output capabilities.  In merging 2.6x1 into the 2.7 series, the
Ramachandran plot capabilities were extended to full printer plot logic
using Frances Bernstein's fisipl (see
<A href="ftp://bnlarchive.rcsb.org/pub/pdb_software/program_tape/fisipl.for">
ftp://bnlarchive.rcsb.org/pub/pdb_software/program_tape/fisipl.for</A>).
<P>
Herbert Bernstein's RasMol 2.6_CIF added the abilty to read either mmCIF
or CIF data sets, and to colour by alternate confomer or model.  The
work on colouring by alternate conformer or model was done in
collaboration with Frances C. Bernstein.
<P>
Roger Sayle's RasMol 2.6.4 was a major cleanup and reorganization of the
source code of RasMol for maintainability.
<P>
Andreas Bohne's RasMol 2.6ab series adds automatic detection of pixel
depth, extended menus, and better scripting capabilities.<BR>
