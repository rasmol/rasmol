   The original RasMol manual was created by Roger Sayle.  In July 1996,
   Dr. Margaret Wong of the Chemistry Department, Swinburne University
   of Technology, Australia, made extensive revisions to the RasMol 2.5
   manual to accurately reflect the operation of RasMol 2.6.  Eric Martz
   of the University of Massachusetts made further revisions.  In May
   1997, William McClure of Carnegie Mellon University reorganized the
   HTML version of the manual into multiple sections which could be
   downloaded quickly and added use of frames.   Portions of the 2.7.1
   version of the RasMol manual were derived with permission from
   William McClure's version using Roger Sayle's rasmol.doc for
   version 2.6.4 as the primary source. Changes were made in August 2000 for
   RasMol version 2.7.2, January 2001 for RasMol version 2.7.1.1, April 2001
   for RasMol version 2.7.2.1 and February 2005 for RasMol version 2.7.3.

                                Translations

   Thanks to the efforts of Jose Miguel Fernandez Fernandez (Departamento
   de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular. Universidad de Granada. Espana
   (jmfernan@ugr.es)) a translation of the Manual for Rasmol version
   2.7.1 into Spanish is now available. La traduccion espanola del manual
   de la version de la Dra. Wong revisada por Eric Martz fue realizada
   por Isabel Servan Martinez y Jose Miguel Fernandez Fernandez. La
   actual traduccion del Manual de RasMol 2.7.1 ha sido realizada usando
   como base la anterior de RasMol 2.6 por  Jose Miguel Fernandez
   Fernandez.

   Thanks to translations by Fernando Gabriel Ranea in late 2000 and
   early 2001, RasMol is now capable of rendering most menu items and
   messages in Spanish. Jean-Pierre Demailly provided French translations
   of menus and messages in January 2001. Giuseppe Martini and Giovanni
   Paolella with contributions by A. Davassi, M. Masullo and C. Liotto
   provided Italian translation of menus and messages in March 2001.

   This version is based in directly on RasMol version 2.7.2.1.1, on RasMol version 2.7.2, on
   RasMol version 2.7.1, on RasMol version 2.6_CIF.2, on RasMol version 2.6x1, on RasMol
   version 2.6.4, and RasMol 2.5-ucb and 2.6-ucb.

    Combining RasMol Variants

   The first steps in combining RasMol variants have been performed. Much of the work of
   upgrading the documentation has been done. It remains to make the changes to prepdoc
   to generate the RasFrames version. Several source mod packages are being reviewed for
   inclusion. Features from other variants of RasMol will be considered for inclusion in
   RasMol 2.7.n if the features are particularly popular and if available resources (or
   helpful colleagues) make inclusion of those features feasible. When we are done,
   probably in the early fall, the resulting best version should be a reasonably stable
   and reliable single version combining most of the features of the major current
   variants of RasMol.

    Some other important things still to be done

     * Add P. Zhivkov's blurring to simulate surfaces.
     * Add OpenGL management of images.
     * Make native Mac OS X version.
     * Add smooth double buffering to switch molecules for movies.
     * Additional language variants.
     * Fix problems with very large zoom scale.
     * Add GUI toolbar interface.
     * Resolve color management issues (including auto-sensing bit depth).
     * Fix printing under windows.
     * Allow for longer names.
     * Add FAQ.
     * Finish incorporating A. Mueller's fixes for color management.
     * CIF and mmCIF write logic.
     * The read logic for large NMR structures on a Mac needs to be made to work.
     * The field widths for alternate conformer ID's and chains need to be extended to
       allow for the more flexible naming in mmCIF.
     * Resolve problem with interaction of stereo and shadows.
     * Allow writing of GIFs from high colour-resolution mode.
     * Improve memory management on Macs to allow larger structures.
